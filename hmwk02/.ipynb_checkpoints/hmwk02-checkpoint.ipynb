Your solutions to computational questions should include any specified Python code and results as well as written commentary on your conclusions.  Remember that you are encouraged to discuss the problems with your instructors and classmates, but **you must write all code and solutions on your own**.  For a refresher on the course **Collaboration Policy** click [here](https://github.com/chrisketelsen/csci3022/blob/master/resources/syllabus.md#collaboration-policy).  \n",

    "- Some problems with code may be autograded.  If we provide a function API please do not change it.  If we do not provide a function API then you're free to structure your code however you like. \n",
    "- It is **bad form** to make your reader interpret numerical output from your code.  If a question asks you to compute some value from the data you should show your code output **AND** write a summary of the results in Markdown directly below your code.\n",
    "- Because you can technically evaluate notebook cells is a non-linear order, it's a good idea to do Cell $\\rightarrow$ Run All as a check before submitting your solutions.  That way if we need to run your code you will know that it will work as expected. \n",

    "\n",
    "In this problem you will write some code to simulate the game of **Miniopoly** (a very rough approximation of [Monopoly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly_(game)).  The game consists of a round board with 40 \"squares\" numbered from $0$ to $40$, where squares $0$ and $40$ are [coincident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coincident) and called **GO**.  A player starts on **GO** with \\$200 in their pocket.  On each turn the player rolls a pair of dice and then moves a number of spaces equal to the sum of the dice.  Landing on different squares have different results: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Squares 2, 7, 17, 22, 33, and 36 cause you to draw a card.  The cards tell you to collect \\$50, \\$100, or \\$200, or pay the bank \\$100 or \\$150.  \n",
    "\n",
    "<p> </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Squares 0, 10, and 20 do not trigger any action \n",
    "\n",
    "<p> </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Square 30 is **Go To Jail**, which sends the player directly to **Jail** and ends the turn \n",
    "\n",
    "<p> </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "- If a player starts a turn from **Jail** she rolls two dice: \n",
    "\n",
    "    - If the player rolls doubles (i.e. the dice have equal values) the player moves from Square 10 a number of squares equal to the sum of the dice\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - If the player rolls anything other than doubles she pays the bank \\$10 and remains in **Jail** \n",
    "    \n",
    "<p> </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the player passes or lands on **GO** she collects \\$200. \n",
    "\n",
    "<p> </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the player lands on any other square not mentioned above, she pays the bank an amount equal to the square's number (e.g. if she lands on Square 29 she pays the bank \\$29). \n",
    "\n",
    "<p> </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "If at any point the player has \\$0 or less they go bankrupt and the game ends. \n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Part A**: Complete the function miniopoly_turn below. The function should simulate one turn of Miniopoly.  It should take as arguments the player's current location on the board as well as the player's current cash reserves, and return the player's new location and cash reserves after the turn has completed. Note that if a player goes bankrupt during the game you should return their cash as 0 instead of a negative value.  "

    "Dan and Chris have been playing board games for ages. Among the games they play a lot are Miniopoly and a similar game with slightly tweaked rules called **Fakeiopoly!**  Being Data-Nerds, they like to record the details of each game they play for future analysis.  Since the games are similar, they store the results for Miniopoly and Fakeiopoly in the same database.  Unfortunately, their data has been corrupted!  The only data that survived are the states (i.e. square numbers) they were on after each of the first 20 turns as well a the amount of cash they had on hand after each of the first 20 turns. This information is stored in the columns **S1**-**S20** and **C1**-**C20** in the following DataFrame. "

    "# How are we going to solve this problem?\n",
    "## Approach description: \n",
    "Considering we know *very* little about the game of fakeiopoloy or whatever it is- we are going to first set up a basis of understanding- by observing the data, we will determine **what rules have persisted, and what rules have changed**, we can do this purely through the observation of the data table to determine the following:\n",
    "* Consider maximum and minimum change in state (how many dice are we using)?\n",
    "* Consider the change in monies when we pass Go (do we get paid more or less than 200)?\n",
    "    * Paid \\$100 at reset of board\n",
    "* Consider if the states locations persist (I.E. Draw cards spots are the same as before)\n",
    "    * On this contingency, can we draw the same cards, or have new cards been drawn?\n",
    "        * ~~Card spots:  2, 7, 17, 22, 33, 36~~\n",
    "        * ~~Do they differ from 50, 100, 200, -100, -150?~~\n",
    "        * Are there more cards (greater weights)?\n",
    "        * Are there different values?\n",
    "        * ~~Has jail moved?~~\n",
    "        * ~~Is it still plot 30?~~\n",
    "        * ~~Are we paying more rent in jail?~~\n",
    "        * ~~Are we leaving jail at a different plot? (Is there an alternate offset than 10?)~~\n",
    "    * ~~Are we paying on a higher scalar value per incremented plot?~~\n",
    "    * ~~Is the board still 0-40?~~\n",
    "        * ~~Is the max value of S1-S20 on fake games ever > 39?~~\n",
    "    \n",
    "# The rules have changed!\n",
    "* We can roll up to 13- meaning we are rolling one 1d6 and one 1d7, summing to 13. Cheeky.\n",
    "    * The max for fake values is 13 in one turn, so obviously, one die goes up to 7.\n",
    "* Second, Let's look at all the card spots:\n",
    "    * New card drawing states: 2, 5, 7, 13, 17, 22, 33, 36\n",
    "    * New card introduced: \\$300, \\$250 (Or, it is possible that we can draw two cards?)\n",
    "* You recieve \\$100 OR \\$200 when passing Go\n",
    "* Jail has not moved, it is at state 30\n",
    "    * Jail rent has not changed, it is \\$10 a turn\n",
    "    * The offset (10) has not changed\n",
    "   \n",
    "We most likely have not found all of the changes, but we can make a prediction at whether or not the game is fake or real, now.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, what should we check?\n",
    "\n",
    "We will know for certain that the game is fake if:\n",
    "* A player collects $\\100 after passing go\n",
    "* A player moves 13 spots in one turn\n",
    "* A player increases in cash in \\$300 or \\$250 increments\n",
    "    * This leads me to believe that the player can draw 2 or more cards in a given turn provided that a certain happenstance occurs, or that there are more cards of variant types. \n",
    "    \n",
    "### VERIFICATION:\n",
    "To verify these steps, all I had to do was check for discrepancies in our tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "I cordoned off the data into two seperate tables: Real data and Fake data- and limited the table to show only changes in state and cash. This made it easy for me to cross reference tables as they were aligned with one another in a columnar fashion and operated in the same manner as a chess or lattice table would (think: E7). \n",
    "\n",
    "The fake data is going to be unpredictable, whereas I can assume that the real data will behave as previously explained. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, I should visually affirm that the rules previously stated are the same, at minimum, and see if any of those rules have changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, I can check other ranges of data and potential areas of difference that arose from questions of the game's complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "I know Fakeiopoly can go up to 13 dice as the maximum roll in turn 1 was 13.\n",
    "\n",
    "I know there were, at minimum, other cards added as cash was fluctuating and changes at values different than the ones previously specified in the card draw steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "# SECONDARY APPROACH ATTEMPT:\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming for just the above was inadequate, so instead, I looked for all cases where the values were not following the rules of the game, as, as far as things can go, my prediction heuristics are going to be along the lines of: \n",
    "\n",
    "\"Fakeiopoly is not following the previously defined rules\". Therefore, I can predict that the game is fake if its cash flow + turn changes contradict the bounds we have been provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond that, it is very challenging (as far as I can tell) to say for certain that the game is real or fake, as they are very close to parallel."
